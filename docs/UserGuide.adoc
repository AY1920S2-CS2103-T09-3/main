== Introduction

ExpenseLA is for money-conscious NUS students who wish to track their spending, in order to make better informed decisions when it comes to saving money. ExpenseLA maintains a record of your daily incoming and outgoing transactions to constantly keep track of your finances! ExpenseLA is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still enjoying the benefits of having a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
