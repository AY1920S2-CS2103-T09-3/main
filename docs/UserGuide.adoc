== Product Overview

ExpenseLA is for money-conscious NUS students who wish to track their spending, in order to make better informed decisions when it comes to saving money. ExpenseLA maintains a record of your daily incoming and outgoing transactions to constantly keep track of your finances! ExpenseLA is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still enjoying the benefits of having a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you want a simple, no-frills expense tracker, look no further than ExpenseLA!

== Quick Start (Hubert Halim)

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `expensela.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
.  The UI has 5 different components: Command Input box, Command Result box, Monthly Data panel
Filter panel and Transaction List panel(Chart Analytics Panel)
+
image::UI_annotated.png[width="790"]
+
.  Filters are only to filter transaction list and chart analytics, MonthlyData is data for the current month and not the month
shown in the filter. So filter does not apply to MonthlyData
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  You can navigate through your command history by pressing the kbd:[Up] or kbd:[Down] arrow key.
Only successful commands are stored in the command history. There can be at most 50 commands stored.
This feature is just like the command navigation feature in your favourite command line or shell.
.  An example command sequence you can try:

* *`clear`* : clear the expenseLa app to start at a clean slate
* *`budget b/1000 rc/`* : set a recurring budget of $1000 for the current month and subsequent months
* *`add i/ c/Income n/salary a/2500 d/2020-04-02 rc/`* : adds a recurring income with amount `$2500.00`

* Parameters are not case sensitive, but prefixes are

* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `spend a/AMOUNT n/ OBJECT [d/ DATE] [c/ CAT]` and can used as `add a/100 n/Pizza` or `add a/100 n/Pizza d/2020-02-02 c/Food`

=== Set a monthly budget : `budget` (Hubert Halim)

Sets a spendable budget for the current month

Format: `budget b/AMOUNT` (to set a budget for the given month only)
        `budget b/AMOUNT rc/` (to set repeating budget of $AMOUNT for the coming months)

Examples:

* `budget b/1000 rc/`
* `budget b/1500`


=== Reset total balance `resetbalance` (Hubert Halim)

Reset Balance value to the total from the amount of all transactions in stored in the application so far.
This command is used in case user messes up with json file or there is an unhandled bug in the app that
causes difference in the value of total balance and the net balance of all the transactions added together.
This command will rectify that issue.


=== Key in transaction : `add`

Adds an expense or income to the expense tracker. Expenses/incomes are stored as a transaction.

Format: `add [i/] n/ NAME a/ AMOUNT [d/ DATE] [c/ CATEGORY] [r/ REMARK]  [rc/]`

Expected Outcome: A new transaction would be created in the list of transactions. If the newly
created transaction is part of the currently filtered transaction, it'll be visible in the list

[TIP]
Leaving the DATE option blank will auto fill with today's date
[TIP]
Leaving the CATEGORY option blank will auto fill with 'MISC' category
[TIP]
Not including i/ will make transaction an expense by default while including i/ will make it an income
[TIP]
Including rc/ will make transaction recurring every month on the same day set in the transaction date

Examples:

* `add a/ 26.00 n/ Grab Share d/ 2020-02-19 c/ TRANSPORT`
* `add a/ 16.00 n/ Pizza r/ Lunch c/ FOOD`
* `add i/ a/ 200.00 n/ pocket money c/INCOME rc/`


=== Filter transactions : `filter`

show transactions that fulfill the filter criteria

Examples:

* `filter m/ 2020-04` (filter by month and remove category filter)
* `filter c/ TRANSPORT` (filter by category and remove month filter)
* `filter m/ 2020-04 c/ FOOD` (filter by both category and month)
