== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*:
** *Monthly Data Tracking*
*** What it does: allows user to keep track of monthly expense, income and budget.
** Justification: This feature allows the user to keep track of how much money they have spend for the month
and how much money they have earned
** Highlights: This enhancement is vital to the functionality of the expense tracker as one of the major reasons users use
an expense tracker is to keep track of this monthly information
** *Budget Tracking and Insights*
*** What it does: allows user to keep track of how much budget they have left with a
graphical interface that shows ratio of expense and budget for the month.
** Justification: This feature makes it easy for user to visualize how much money they have left that they can spend
for the month
** Highlights: The enhancement is a huge quality of life update for users as it has a graphical interface
that makes it easy for user to visualize how much budget they have left. It is also color coded as to serve as a warning
if the user only has very little money left that they can spend
** *Recurring Budget*
*** What it does: allows user to set a budget for every subsequent months.
** Justification: Usually budgets for every month are constant so it makes sense to be able to
set budget for every subsequent months
** Highlights: This enhancement made it easier for users to use the app as they only need to
set their budget once provided that it remains the same


* *Minor enhancement*: added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.
