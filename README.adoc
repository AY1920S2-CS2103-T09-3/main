* This is a desktop Expense Tracking application. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
* It is a Java sample application intended for students learning Software Engineering while using Java as the main programming language.
* It is *written in OOP fashion*. It provides a *reasonably well-written* code example that is *significantly bigger* (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in most beginner-level SE modules.
* This application is intended to users of all ages and backgrounds as it will provide useful information and analytics for anyone looking to make better financial decisions.
